        <p>Hi! My name is Erin Shawhan and I am currently a sophomore at the
            University of Missouri. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in
            Information Technology and a minor in Psychology. This site
            provides some information about myself as well as some of my
            academic and work experience. I also included a program I wrote
            in Python to showcase some of my coding experience.
        </p>
